# Selenium Test Automation Framework

This is a Selenium-based test automation framework built using Node.js. It allows you to run automated tests on web applications using different browsers, such as Chrome. The framework is designed to be modular and extendable, allowing you to add more tests and extend the functionality as needed.

## Features

- **Cross-browser Testing**: Run tests on different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, etc.).
- **Chai Assertions**: Use Chai for assertions to ensure your tests are reliable.
- **Report Generation**: Generates HTML reports for each test run.
- **Modular**: Easily extendable to include more tests and functionality.
